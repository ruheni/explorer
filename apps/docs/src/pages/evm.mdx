# EVM

Some data is not accessible via direct RPC calls to protocol nodes. That is why we have built a custom indexer that is compatible with all EVM chains. Using this API, it is possible to get extra data that might be useful for users, such as NFT holdings, token balances, and more. {{ className: 'lead' }}
